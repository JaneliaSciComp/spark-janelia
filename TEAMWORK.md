# Teamwork!

This is to help organize usage of spark on Janelia's cluster. So long as cluster resources remain limited, and we haven't migrated fully to cloud compute, we need to work together as a team!

#### How it works

Everyone should try to indicate a few times of day that you are most likely to use the cluster (rough hours), and what your usage typically is (number of nodes). List that information below your handle in this document.

- If you need to add yourself to this list, let us know in the chatroom and we'll make you a contributor.
- If you need to update *your own* time, just modify this document.
- If you want to "swap" times with someone, i.e. ask them to change their usual time, make an issue. Ask nicely!
- If you want to reserve a special one-time time slot (e.g. for an experiment), make an issue letting everyone know.
