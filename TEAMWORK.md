# Teamwork!

This is to help organize usage of spark on Janelia's cluster. So long as cluster resources remain limited, we need to do this as a team!

How it works:

- If you regularly use Spark on the cluster, try to indicate a few times that you are most likely to use it, and what your usage typically is (number of nodes). You can specify a particular day, or, more likely, a particular time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). List that information below your handle here in this document.
- If you need to update *your own* time, just modify this document.
- If you want to "swap" times with someone, i.e. ask them to change their usual time, make an issue letting them know. Ask nicely!
- If you want to reserve a really special one-time time slot (e.g. right before an experiment), make an issue letting everyone know.
